# Landmark Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning-based system for **landmark detection and classification**. 
It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of landmarks into their respective categories.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Preprocessed and analyzed a dataset of landmark images with over 20,000 samples.
- Implemented **data cleaning, class balancing, and visualization** using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- Built and trained a **CNN model** using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.
- Utilized OpenCV and PIL for image processing and handling.
- Designed to demonstrate scalable classification across multiple landmark categories.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Pillow
